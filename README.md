# LLMs for Accessibility

Project for MOBIDEV classes at the University of Milan.

This application leverages Large Language Models (specifically GPT-4o) as an accessibility tool for visually impaired users of Augmented Reality applications. It provides descriptions of both real and virtual environments and allows users to ask specific questions.
